# Brain-Tumor-Detector
The integration of advanced technology into healthcare is enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing human error. Computer vision, in particular, plays a crucial role in improving medical diagnoses. For instance, analyzing MRI scans for brain-related conditions demands intense focus, as any misjudgment can have severe consequences. MRI imaging is capable of detecting even the smallest anomalies in the human body. To enhance this process, we train a model specifically designed to identify these subtle abnormalities in MRI scans and accurately predict the presence of tumors. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be one of the most effective techniques for addressing this challenge.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) analyze MRI scans by learning hierarchical patterns in the images. The process involves:  

1. **Preprocessing:** MRI images are resized, normalized, and augmented to improve model performance.  
2. **Feature Extraction:** CNN layers apply convolution operations to detect edges, textures, and patterns relevant to tumor identification.  
3. **Pooling Layers:** Reduce dimensionality while preserving essential features.  
4. **Fully Connected Layers:** Classify the extracted features and make predictions.  
5. **Training & Optimization:** The model is trained on labeled MRI scans using loss functions and optimization algorithms to improve accuracy.  

This approach enables CNNs to detect even subtle anomalies in MRI scans with high precision.
